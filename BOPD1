Division of Labor
We have 6 members of our team labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 whose number is labeled next to the group or category they work with or manage. The Create builders and programmers will work together and the Demobot/LEGO Robot builders and programmers will work together. The strategizers and managers will work with both groups and keep them focused. Together, we will work for different goals and intervene to share new ideas and create smarter building and coding ideas.

Create Build Team: Team Members; 3, 5, 6
Demobot/LEGO Robot Build Team: Team Members; 3, 5, 6
Create Programming Team: Team Members; 1, 2, 5
Demobot/LEGO Robot Programming Team: Team Members; 1, 2, 4, 5
Documentation Team: Team Members; 5, 6
Team Managers: Team Members; 4
Strategizers: Team Members; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Conflict Resolution
Our team has agreed that if one or more team members disagree with one or more other team members, our team will handle the matter the following fashion or fashions:

Team member with disagreeing points of view will first meet face to face. The two or more disagreeing team members will begin a peaceful and respectful discussion, occasionally with another team member that represents a neutral point of view/judge. Then one of the disagreeing team member will discuss the issue from their point of view. The other disagreeing teammate will then present the issue from their point of view. Then they will present solutions to the issue and try to agree on one or form a compromise. If the disagreeing team members do not agree on a solution or compromise the neutral team/judge member will form a solution or compromise. 
If the two or more disagreeing team members do not agree on a solution or compromise, and the neutral/judge team member cannot decide on one of the solutions or compromises or come up with one of their own, the remaining team members will respond in a democratic way. A team meeting will be called by the neutral team member/judge and they will present the issue. Both sides of of the argument will present their solutions. The remaining team members will act as a jury and choose on of the suggested solutions or come up with their own compromise.
If in the extremely rare occasions solution or compromise still hasn’t been reached, the issue will be brought to our elected officers. Then the officers will either choose one of the presented solutions or compromises, or come up with one of their own. 
If the officers happen to be absent, extremely busy, taking care of a more serious matter, or not wanting to be disturbed, we will not present the issue to them. During this instance, we will then present the issue to our adult supervisor/team leader. Our adult supervisor/team leader will then choose one of the suggested solutions or compromises or come up with their own.
